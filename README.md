# MMO-LightSabers
Miniature Multi-site Optogenetics LightSabers software : user gui and calibration software

Supported by Force Avenir +

This project is aimed at creating a miniature site-selective optogenetics light delivery tool with high spatial resolution and configurability. This GitHub Repo is the home of the programation used in this project. Three main parts will be developped:

1. A electrically tunable injections lens controller, that will aim at creating a g-code like experience for the position of the focal point.
2. An optimization 'dance' for the determination of parameters for each channel in the MMO LightSaber that will use #1 + a Nelder-Mead algo 
3. A user-friendly GUI for the in-vivo use of MMO LightSabers
